Project: Medical Named Entity Recognition and Linking

This project extracts medical entities from forum posts and links them to medical codes.

Workflow:
1.  **Entity Enumeration**: Analyzes entity types and frequencies in the CADEC dataset.
2.  **NER with a Pre-trained Model**: Uses a Hugging Face model to identify Drugs, Diseases, Symptoms, and ADRs.
3.  **Standard Evaluation**: Measures NER performance with strict matching (exact text and label).
4.  **ADR-focused Evaluation**: Evaluates ADR detection against MedDRA annotations.
5.  **Relaxed Evaluation**: Uses a more flexible evaluation metric, allowing for partial span overlaps.
6.  **Entity Linking**: Links detected ADRs to SNOMED-CT codes using fuzzy matching and sentence embeddings.
